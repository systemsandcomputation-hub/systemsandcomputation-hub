# Systems and Computation

Systems and Computation is a research direction focused on discovering
stable structure in complex systems.

The work explores how diverse systems — biological, physical, and cognitive —
naturally organize into persistent regimes without requiring models,
training, or domain-specific assumptions.

Rather than predicting outcomes, the emphasis is on identifying
**invariants**: structural patterns that endure despite surface-level noise.

## What This Is About

Across many domains, complex behavior appears chaotic at the local level
but becomes structured when viewed through relationships and persistence.

This work investigates questions such as:

- Why do systems settle into stable modes of behavior?
- How can regime boundaries be detected without labels or supervision?
- What properties are shared by systems as different as proteins,
  simulated cells, and human cognition?

The approach is intentionally minimal and topology-first.

## Public Phase-1 Artifacts

This profile links to a series of small, inspectable repositories that
demonstrate the same structural phenomenon across different domains:

- **Cell Lab** — synthetic cellular dynamics
- **Protein Lab (HP35)** — molecular folding
- **Neural Lab (EEG)** — human brain activity

Each repository presents a Phase-1 artifact:
a single figure showing persistent regimes emerging directly from data.

The internal engines used to produce these artifacts are not released.

## Philosophy

Complex systems do not behave randomly.
They explore possibilities — then commit.

These commitments leave structural traces.
The goal is to find them.

## Status

This work is ongoing.
Public repositories represent early-phase demonstrations, not final theory.
